# weather-map

Free Api by http://openweathermap.org

I was planning to practice this for so long. But for some reasons, I didn't do it.
Today, I was having no sleep. So I searched for a html template on google for this, and found a template with also Javascript.
Then I modified some of the HTML, CSS and also Javascript and changed it.

For the first time, I used a Javascript code while practicing JavaScript. I loved his code. So first I understand full of his code. Then I edited some codes.

Thank you George Martsouko for this amazing template.
